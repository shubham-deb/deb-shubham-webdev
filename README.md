# WEB-DEVELOPMENT
My name is Shubham Deb and I am currently pursuing Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University.
I have done internships at CRISIL and Schneider Electric before coming to the US. I was a TA for Algorithms during fall 2016 where I solved students' doubts and conducted quizzes and graded their papers.
I recently won second prize at NEU Hackathon competition where we built a chatbot that can accept input in the form of Text, Voice or Gestures. 
This is my repository where it contains all the assignments and project that I have worked on when I took the web development course during summer 2017.
